雖然大腦分區的圖解很多、相關方法學的理論也很成熟，
但當研究者需要簡單的用節點與線段呈現結果時，多半依賴人工主觀的繪製

Although there's lots of atlas for brain anatomy segmentation,
the methodology theory also mature,
but when researcher need to draw their results by node and vertex, they still subjective drawing.

這個 AALSlicing.r in R 希望能將現有的電腦解剖圖解的座標應用在圖 (Graph) 上，
方便研究者快速的產出進一步的圖示。

This AALSlicing.r in R use current automatic anatomy atlas coordination on graph,
help researcher convenience product their own graph.

方法為:
將各腦區、視為以原體積大小的三次方根為半徑的圓球，
在該切面上做截面。

The method is:
Considering every brain region as sphere which radius is three root of original size,
plot a section on assign slice.
